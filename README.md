Online Code Editor!

![alt text](https://i.ibb.co/QfBJ5N5/hbook.png)

This is front-end React.js and Typescript application. App is like online code editor(CLI) where users can run their code, test it, implement css files and almost all npm 
packages can be implement. Also app have Markdown text editor where user can write text and preview it.
To build this application I have used next technologies:

    * React
      - Redux
        - redux-thunk
      - Hooks
    * Typescript
    * esbuild(for bundling the code)
    * immer(to simplify process with redux)
    * axios
    * bulmaswatch(for styling)
    * monaco-editor
    * @uiw/react-md-editor
    
#### Note: While building this app I have learned a lot about Typescript and I can say that I have strong knowledge with Typescript!

## Important
  When you use the app please be patinet. Code may be running slower beacuse I use free sites for deployment, and therefore the requests are slower.
  
# Thank you!
